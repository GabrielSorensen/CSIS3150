Greetings.

This Repository is a collection of files and other junk that I either wrote or used for my Southern Utah Univerity CSIS 3150 class.

-If you are taking this class, good luck. Feel Free to CONSULT here for anything that you might need for class. Remember you need to learn something, not just copy code.

****Feel free to email me and ask for any permissions you need to borrow and use whatever code here****
